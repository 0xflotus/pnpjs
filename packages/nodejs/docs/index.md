# @pnp/nodejs

This package supplies helper code when using the other libraries within the context of nodejs. All of the shared nodejs functionality is included
as size concerns are generally less important and for simplicity. This also removes the node specific functionality from any of the packages. Primarily
these consist of clients to enable use of the libraries in nodejs.
