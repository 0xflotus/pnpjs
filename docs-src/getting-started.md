# Getting Started

These libraries are geared towards folks working with TypeScript but will work equally well for JavaScript projects. To get started you need to install
the libraries you need via npm. Many of the packages have a peer dependency to other packages with the @pnp namespace meaning you may need to install
more than one package. All packages are released together eliminating version confusion.
