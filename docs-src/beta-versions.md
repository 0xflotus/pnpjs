# Beta Versions

To help folks try out new features early and provide feedback prior to releases we periodically publish beta versions of the packages. These will
be released as a set with matching version numbers, just like when we do a normal release. There is no set schedule for beta releases. While not 
ready for production use we encourage you to try out these pre-release packages and provide us feedback.

## Installing

To install the beta packages in your project you use the @beta version number on the packages. This applies to all packages, not just the ones
shown in the example below.

```
npm install @pnp/logging@beta @pnp/common@beta @pnp/odata@beta --save
```

Do please remember that it is always possible something does not work in a beta version, so be aware and if you find something please [report an
issue](https://github.com/pnp/pnp/issues).
