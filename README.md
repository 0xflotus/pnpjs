## Pre-release Beta Note

The software packages within this repo are currently pre-release and should be treated as beta versions. Please check them out and feel free to install them for use in non-production projects. We have documentation, samples, and guides coming - but for now have a look around and try things out.

The following gulp commands are currently working: build, package, test, lint, and clean. Additionally F5 debugging works with ./debug/debug.ts - which can easily be modified to call other files.

Have a look around and let us know what you think :)
