        <h1>@pnp/common/netutil</h1>
<p>This module contains a set of classes and interfaces used to caracterize shared http interactions and configuration of the libraries. Some of the interfaces
are described below (many have no use outside the library) as well as several classes.</p>
<h2>Interfaces</h2>
<h3>HttpClientImpl</h3>
<p>Defines an implementation of an Http Client within the context of @pnp. This being a class with a a single method “fetch” take a URL and
options and returning a Promise&lt;Response&gt;. Used primarily with the shared request pipeline to define the client used to make the actual request.</p>
<h3>RequestClient</h3>
<p>An abstraction that contains specific methods related to each of the primary request methods get, post, patch, delete as well as fetch and fetchRaw. The
difference between fetch and fetchRaw is that a client may include additional logic or processing in fetch, where fetchRaw should be a direct call to the
underlying HttpClientImpl fetch method.</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>Thid module export two classes of note, FetchClient and BearerTokenFetchClient. Both implement HttpClientImpl.</p>
<h3>FetchClient</h3>
<p>Basic implementation that calls the global (window) fetch method with no additinoal processing.</p>
<h3>BearerTokenFetchClient</h3>
<p>A simple implementation that takes a provided authentication token and adds the Authentication Bearer header to the request. No other processing is done and
the token is treated as a static string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-TypeScript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { BearerTokenFetchClient } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"@pnp/common"</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> client = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> BearerTokenFetchClient(<span class="hljs-string">"{authentication token}"</span>);

client.fetch(<span class="hljs-string">"{url}"</span>, {});
