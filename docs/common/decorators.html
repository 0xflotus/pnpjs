        <h1>@pnp/common/decorators</h1>
<p>This module contains two decorators used internally to communicate if a feature is either being deprecated or in beta</p>
<h2>deprecated</h2>
<p>Used to tag methods, properties, or classes that are deprecated and will be removed in future versions. By policy we maintain a feature for at least one release
after tagging it and before removing it. It takes a single argument that indicates the target version for removal.</p>
<h2>beta</h2>
<p>Used to tag methods, properties, or classes that are in beta and subject to change. This is generally used when the underlying REST endpoint is tagged as beta to
let folks know a given piece of functionality is subject to change.</p>
